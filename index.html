          Every card purchase starts as a debit: an amount authorized, posted and eventually settled. This page explains how debits appear on your statement, how they can be reversed and what they mean for balances over time.

    <!-- Overview -->
    <section id="overview" class="section">
      <h2>What Is a Debit on a Card Account?</h2>
      <p>On a credit-card account, a debit is a transaction that increases the amount you owe: purchases, fees, interest charges and certain adjustments. Debits move money from the card’s available limit into your used balance.</p>
      <p>In statements and online banking, debits are usually shown as charges, while credits are shown as refunds, payments or other positive adjustments. Both sides together form the history of how the balance changes over time.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Mechanics -->
    <section id="mechanics" class="section">
      <h2>From Authorization to Posting</h2>
      <p>Most card debits move through two phases: an authorization and a posting. The exact labels vary by issuer, but the logic is similar.</p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li><strong>Authorization</strong> – the issuer temporarily reserves part of your limit when a merchant requests approval.</li>
        <li><strong>Clearing &amp; settlement</strong> – the final amount is sent through the network after the transaction is completed.</li>
        <li><strong>Posting</strong> – the settled transaction becomes part of your official balance and statement.</li>
        <li><strong>Adjustments</strong> – if the amount changes, additional debits or credits may be posted to correct it.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This is why you may briefly see “pending” activity before the same item appears as a posted debit on your account.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Types of Debits on a Card Statement</h2>
      <p>Not all debits come from everyday purchases. Common debit categories include:</p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li><strong>Retail and online purchases</strong> – standard card transactions at merchants.</li>
        <li><strong>Cash advances</strong> – ATM withdrawals or similar, often with separate fees and interest rules.</li>
        <li><strong>Fees</strong> – annual fees, late fees, returned-payment fees and other charges defined in your agreement.</li>
        <li><strong>Interest charges</strong> – debits that represent accumulated interest on carried balances.</li>
        <li><strong>Manual adjustments</strong> – back-office corrections if a prior posting was incomplete or inaccurate.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The statement usually labels each entry so you can see which debits come from usage versus pricing components.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Reversals, Refunds and Disputed Debits</h2>
      <p>Some debits are later reversed or offset. Depending on the situation, you may see:</p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li><strong>Merchant refunds</strong> – credits that reverse all or part of a purchase after a return or correction.</li>
        <li><strong>Chargeback credits</strong> – temporary or final credits while a dispute is investigated.</li>
        <li><strong>Fee waivers</strong> – credits that offset previously posted fees.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Even when a debit is reversed, it may have affected your interim balance and utilization. How that interacts with your credit file depends on timing, reporting practices and other factors set by the issuer and bureaus.</p>
